Hello everyone! Before doing any technical entries on this blog, I'd like to start from the beginning and tell you who am I.

My name is Pere Viader Masuet, and I am from Catalonia, Spain.

My story starts just like the story of many many other people in this industry. I got a Nintendo console [0] when I was a kid and this changed my life forever. This however could not have happened without my parents, they saw my love for the games and were very supportive about it (even though I spent too much time playing with them). They understood that there was something more about games and provided me with the games that thought me the love for this media.

As a player and developer I deeply believe the games we play at a young age deeply affect how we grow up and end up thinking for the rest of our lives. So in order for you to understand who I am, I want to give you a comprehensive list of all [1] the games I played at a young age from the first one in 1998 up to 2010 [2] which I deem is a good enough sample. The collection will include some commentary for the games I deem relevant and a trophy 🏆 to the best ones.

# Game Boy Color (1999-2001)

My first console ever was the [Game Boy Color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color) and I fondly remember the time spent playing these games:

- 🏆[Pokémon Silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver): Fun story about this game, it taught me how to read and in a foreign language. As a kid of around 4-5 years old in a Catalan home environment, I did not speak nor read Spanish. When I got this game, I asked my parents for translation on every text box. As it was not feasible for them to translate and read each and every one of them for me, they told me to find a way to understand it for myself and to their surprise [3], it worked, because soon after I was playing through the game all by myself.
- [Pokémon Gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver): Did not play it but the memory is very much there. The copy of the game I got came with an empty battery, so the game save file was wiped every time I powered the system off. Playing through starting area stopped being fun after the 45th time :P.
- 🏆[Wario Land 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wario_Land_3): While writing this article, I couldn't stop myself from watching a gameplay for this game. It was great!
- [Tintin In Tibet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintin_in_Tibet_(video_game))
- [Pokémon Puzzle Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Puzzle_Challenge)

# Game Boy Advance (2001-2004)

Some years later, I got my next console, the brand new [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) followed by more great games (and not so great ones):

# Nintendo DS (2004-2009)

I also got some niceties for it, an [R4 cartridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R4_cartridge) and an [Action Replay](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Action_Replay), I'll never forget the fun of modding the towns in Animal Crossing or creating the perfect team for Pokémon Pearl.

- [The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Third_Age): I have a great story about it. This was one of the 2 games I got when we bought the console. It was a brand-new so I opened the sealed package and started playing it immediately. Later, once I looked at the back of the box, I wondered the art and description were so different from the game, however I never gave it any thought. About 7 years later, while I was cleaning the game's library, I found out that the game I got was not the one supposed to be in that box! The box was for [The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King_(video_game)). It will always be a mystery to me how a different game ended up in a sealed box in a retail store.

# PC (1999-2010)

- [Pac Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man): This was the first videogame I played as a kid. It was on an old spare computer my father had. The computer must have had something wrong with it because whenever I touched it I got a bit electrified
- [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris)
- 🏆[Uncle Albert's Magical Album, Uncle Albert’s Fabulous Voyage, Uncle Albert’s Mysterious Island, Le Temple perdu de l'oncle Ernest, La Statuette maudite de l'oncle Ernest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Albert%27s_Adventures): These games will be in my mind forever. They turned my young self into a videogame puzzle lover. I can still remember the mistery and excitement coming from the pages these game takes part in. It is a shame I can't replay this game, it relies on techonolgy that is too old to run under the new fancy operating systems. I'd be very happy if I ever could replay them.
- 🏆[NosTale](https://nostale.fandom.com/wiki/NosTale): This is the MMO I played for the longer time I always ask myself why I picked this one over more mainstream ones: WOW, Dofus... In any case, I it tought me a lot: personal relationships, guild management, economy, trade, effort, persistence... Games are truly a great place to learn.
- 🏆[Tibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibia_(video_game)): The thrill of killing monsters casting magic spells by writing them in the chat was, magic [4]. It was the first game which got me closer to networking and servers. After playing the original game, I got into custom servers which in turn got me curious into trying to make one for myself. Even if I couldn't do it, and the server never went online, I learned a lot.
- 🏆[Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft): Just like Tibia, I also got into creating servers for it, but unlike tibia, I did successfuly create servers for it.

- 🏆[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_4:_Modern_Warfare): Even though this category is for PC, I got this game for a macOS computer. It was quite difficult playing an FPS game at 12-20 fps. [6]


If you are interested in my studies, projects or work related info about me, I do my best keep my [LinkedIn account](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pere-viader-masuet/) up to date.


And with this, I am off to write something that will probably be of more interest to you.

[0] I love how Nintendo is the start of so many people, I wonder what will future generations say.

[1] I am sure I played more games, I'll be adding them if they ever come to mind.

[2] I've tried my best to figure out the exact dates but to no avail so, dates are orientative and may not be accurate.

[3] They are surprised even to this day. I am surprised too, how in heavens name did I do it.

[4] ;)

[5] A.K.A. the grind.

[6] When I got a better computer and played the game on it, the feeling was amazing. The performance increased from the 12-20 fps to a whooping 30-50! Aiming was a piece of pie in comparision.
